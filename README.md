# pow-lock-encryption
A proof-of-work based encryption system where the server performs minimal work to encrypt data, and the client must solve a computational puzzle to decrypt it. This system ensures that the client performs significant work to access the encrypted data, making it suitable for scenarios where computational effort is required for data access.
